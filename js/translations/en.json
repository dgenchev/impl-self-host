        "Fast – designed for immediate loading – within 72 hours",
        "Safe – the operation is simple and requires no bone augmentation",
        "Less painful – no additional pain apart from tooth extraction",

    "q2": {
      "title": "Why Immediate Dental Implants?",
      "description": "It is a modern system for strategic dental implantology. The cortical bone is central to this implantology system. It has a dense outer surface which is resistant to bending and torsion and makes it ideal for weight bearing. Therefore, immediate dental implants do not require the costly procedures of bone grafting and sinus lifting. This minimizes the total cost, time, and effort expended, which translates into faster, cheaper, and less painful experience for the patient."

      "title": "What is Immediate Dental Implantology?",
      "subtitle": "You are saving, because:",
      "items": [
        "No bone augmentation or sinus lift necessary – amounting to 30% of the treatment cost.",
        "The procedure lasts one week not 3-6 months, meaning you don't need expensive temporary constructions – amounting to 20% of the treatment cost.",
        "The procedure is predictable, which allows us to fix the price. Conventional implantology may in some cases lead to a series of unexpected expenses.",
        "Fewer appointments and hours spent with the implantologist."
